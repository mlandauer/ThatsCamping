	<h1>"Its raining and my weetbix is wet. <em>That's campin!"</em></h1>

	<p>The app's namesake is a yearly event when an extended group of friends
	leave the city lights of Sydney behind to get together, go camping
	and see in the new
	year surrounded by good friends, good food and the delights of the
	Australian Bush.</p>

	<p>That's Campin! was made by <a href="http://twitter.com/matthewlandauer">Matthew Landauer</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/katska">Kat Szuminska</a></p>

	<p>Thanks to fellow enthusiasts at <a href="http://www.wildwalks.com">www.wildwalks.com</a> for the campsite
	location data and the <a href="http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/">NSW Department of Environment, Climate Change
	and Water</a> (DECCW) for all other campsite and park details. We are in no

	<p>When we're not making free things for fun on our holidays, we're making free and useful things for fun with the
	OpenAustralia Foundation. Oops. Things like
	the websites <a href="http://www.openaustralia.org">openaustralia.org</a>, which makes it really easy to see what your
	politicians are doing and saying on your behalf in Federal parliament and
	<a href="http://www.planningalerts.org.au">planningalerts.org.au</a>, which sends you emails when anyone in your area is planning
	to build something or knock something down.</p>
