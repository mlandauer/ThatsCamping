h1. "Its raining and my weetbix is wet. _That's Campin!"_

The app's namesake is a yearly event when an extended group of friends leave the city lights of Sydney behind to get together, go camping and see in the new year surrounded by good friends, good food and the delights of the Australian bush.

When we're not making free things for fun on our holidays, we're making free and useful things for fun with the OpenAustralia Foundation. Oops. Things like the websites "openaustralia.org":http://www.openaustralia.org, which makes it really easy to see what your politicians are doing and saying on your behalf in Federal parliament and "planningalerts.org.au":http://www.planningalerts.org.au, which sends you emails when anyone in your area is planning to build something or knock something down.
