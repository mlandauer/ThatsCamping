      <string>More than three million people come to Blue Mountains National Park each year. For many it's enough just to find a lookout and gaze across the park's chiselled sandstone outcrops and hazy blue forests. Others walk or cycle along the cliff-tops and in the valleys, following paths that were created for Victorian-era honeymooners, or discovered by Aboriginal hunters many thousands of years ago. Over 140 km of walking tracks of all grades (some accessible for people with a disability) in diverse settings make the Blue Mountains a bushwalker's paradise.

This park, which is part of the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area, protects an unusually diverse range of vegetation communities. There are rare and ancient plants and isolated animal populations tucked away in its deep gorges. The , winner of the 2008 Australian Tourism Award for New Tourism Development, links a vast and spectacular world heritage landscape and a number of national parks to the regions that surround it.Greater Blue Mountains Drive</string>

It forms an important link in a system of conservation reserves stretching over 600 km along the great eastern escarpment of southern NSW and eastern Victoria. 

To the north is the Bega Valley with a scenic backdrop of rugged, forested mountain peaks, and sweeping escarpment. Landscapes in the middle of the park feature a ring of mountainous country and include gorges and deep valleys that descend into the picturesque Towamba River valley below. In the far south mountains rising to 1000 m descend into the plateaus that lead into the remote gorges of the Genoa wilderness.</string>

      <string>Mt Kaputar National Park is a rugged island of wilderness, towering high above the surrounding Western Plains. It's the footprint left behind by a series of volcanic eruptions that moved across this area between 17 and 21 million years ago.

Millions of years of erosion have carved this volcanic pile into the Nandewar Range, with its dramatic landscape of lava terraces, volcanic plugs and ring dykes. At the peak of the range is Mt Kaputar, which reaches an altitude of 1510m. There are superb views from the summit, as well as from many other lookouts in the park.

The park protects a wide variety of plant communities, including semi-arid woodlands, wet eucalypt forests and subalpine heaths. It's home to a host of animal species, and provides a haven for many threatened species - including bats, birds, wallabies, quolls and a unique large pink slug, which often appears after rain.</string>

In this idyllic oasis the silence of the desert accompanies the sounds of birds and animals.

Amongst the rocky cliffs secrets of an ancient culture are revealed. Dotted throughout the maze of overhangs and rock faces lie an array of Aboriginal rock art and engravings, providing evidence of continuous occupation of this area stretching back over 8 000 years. The scattered remains of fireplaces, stone flakes and grinding stones on the flats paint a picture of the day-to-day life of the people who once occupied the area. The park was returned to its traditional owners in 1998 and is held on their behalf by the Mutawintji Local Aboriginal Land Council.

Visitors most commonly accompany guides into the areas where Aboriginal rock art can be seen and photographed. Guides also tell stories of Dreamtime legends relating to the creation of the landscapes.</string>

      <key>description</key>
      <string>Steeped in history and abounding in natural wonders, Dharug National Park's multi-coloured sandstone landscape protects vital clear-water tributaries. The historic Old Great North Road is an intact and spectacular example of early 19th century road-building as well as a lesson in planning gone wrong. Abandoned even before it was finished, it took the toil and sweat of convicts to quarry, dress and shift the huge sandstone blocks that form the road's striking retaining walls and bridges. You can also experience the park's natural beauty on one of its many great walking tracks.</string>

Nymboi-Binderay National Park lies north of Dorrigo and comprises part of the former Wild Cattle Creek, Clouds Creek and Kangaroo Creek state forests. It includes patches of the rare Dorrigo white gum.

      <string>Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park is where the Hawkesbury River meets the sea: a tight cluster of secretive, winding creeks, sheltered beaches, hidden coves and wide expanses of deep blue water. You'll find heathlands on the sandstone ridges, dense forests on the slopes, and mangroves on the tidal mudflats.

The park's scenic beauty is combined with a rich Aboriginal heritage and a strong sense of history. So it's hardly surprising that millions of walkers, boaters, swimmers and picnickers have visited this icon Sydney park since it opened in 1894.

On 12 July 2006 this park was added to the .National Heritage List</string>
